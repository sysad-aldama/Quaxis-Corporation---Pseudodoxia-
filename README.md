I am currently developing a really real 'fake' data generator python/django/data engineering project. I have been looking everywhere for specific datasets and I cannot find any! So I am going to create my own. This is to assist anyone who is looking to get into data science/analytics/predictive analysis and needs quick data that caters to your specific needs. Generate unlimited realistic pseudo retail data to perform one of the following:
<br>
### ***Variance, Correlation, Time Series, Covariance, Mean, Median, Mode, Linear Regression, Percentiles, Moments, Normal (gaussian) distribution, Heat maps, Standard deviation, Etc...***
<br>
Create your set, your way so you can practice and learn more about gaining insight into data... not THIS data. Use THIS data as a learning tool.

### ***Data is distributed in a weighted manner although some data may be normally distributed ultimately leading into:***

-Time/Date/Location/Price/Combined product grouping specific sales data

### ***EX: more sales in december at 11am or 5pm in NYC.***
<br>
Higher priced items are less weighted than less priced items.
<br>
The API will serve requests while the module allows for customized data sets
<br>
***You can generate any kind of retail transactions just think it through and create the set.***
